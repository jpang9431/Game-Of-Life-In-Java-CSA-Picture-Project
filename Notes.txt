To Do:
Make a selctor image for dice block.
Test dice block.
Make a button to change entire screen to one block (may be laggy)


Ideas:
Zombie? (Few alpha zombie start) infects alive block to make beta zombies, if all alpha zombies die all zombies die
we should scrap the zombie idea, i think we have enough content as is

Virus (If in contact with alive spread virus) turns alive block dead in (some amount) of turns (yellowish heart)
Healer (Removes virus from alive block if in contact, also turns zombie to dead block) (does not die) moves randomly 1 block if not healing
Menu for ruleset?(see lower ruleset possiblities)

Rulesets:
Change screen size
Change amount of life block needed for new life block (max and min)
Change background color?

Notes:
Creating another fork to combine it with tutorial new name will be TutorialAndGame
